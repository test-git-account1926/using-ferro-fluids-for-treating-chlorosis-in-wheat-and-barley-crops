# Research project: Using Ferro Fluids for Treating Chlorosis in Wheat and Barley Crops

This research project was created with [The Research Company](https://theresearchcompany.ai)

## Project Structure

- `paper_drafts/` - Draft versions of research papers
- `grant_proposals/` - Grant proposal documents  
- `bit_flip.jsonl` - Tracked bit (problems) and flip (solutions)
- `paper.jsonl` - Literature review papers and references
- `proposal.jsonl` - Experiment proposals and evaluation plans
- `run.jsonl` - Experiment runs and execution tracking
- `analysis.jsonl` - Experiment analyses and findings
- `experiments/` - Organized experiment folders
  - Each experiment contains: `plan.md`, `result.md`, `run/`, `analysis/`
- `related_work/` - Literature review notes and paper summaries
- `section_notes/` - Working notes for paper sections
- `data/` - Research data (max 2GB per file, use Git LFS for larger)
- `.github/workflows/` - Automated workflows including Claude AI assistant
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI research assistant instructions

## Getting Started

1. Start by documenting your bit (problem) and flip (solution) in `bit_flip.jsonl`
2. Add papers to `paper.jsonl` and conduct literature review in `related_work/`
3. Propose experiments in `proposal.jsonl`
4. Execute experiments and track in `run.jsonl`
5. Analyze results in `analysis.jsonl`
6. Draft your paper in `paper_drafts/`

## Research Methodology

This project follows the CS197 research methodology. See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed guidance.
