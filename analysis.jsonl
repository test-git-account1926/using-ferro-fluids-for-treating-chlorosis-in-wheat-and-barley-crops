Performance scales sub-linearly with number of heads\n2. 4-8 heads optimal for base model size\n3. Diminishing returns beyond 8 heads (p<0.05)\n4. Training time scales linearly with heads","statisticalTests":{"anova_f_statistic":15.23,"anova_p_value":0.0001,"post_hoc_tukey":"Significant differences between 1-4 heads, no significant difference between 8-16 heads"},"visualizations":["figures/head_ablation_bleu_curve.png","figures/training_time_vs_heads.png"],"implications":"Suggests attention head count should scale with model dimension. For deployment, 8 heads provides best performance/compute tradeoff.","nextSteps":"1. Test scaling laws with larger models\n2. Investigate head pruning techniques\n3. Analyze attention patterns across heads","createdDate":"2024-01-23T10:00:00Z"}
