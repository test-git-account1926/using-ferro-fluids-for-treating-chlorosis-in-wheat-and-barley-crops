## Overview

This research tests four fundamental bit-flips in agricultural iron delivery through ferrofluid technology. Our experimental approach follows CS197 methodology, prioritizing experiments that test core assumptions first and maximize learning per unit time. Each experiment directly challenges established assumptions in plant nutrition and agricultural technology.

**Core Research Vectoring**: The highest-risk assumption is whether ferrofluids can actually deliver bioavailable iron better than traditional methods. This forms the foundation for all subsequent experiments.

## Planned Experiments

### Experiment 1: Ferrofluid vs. Traditional Iron Bioavailability (Core Bit-Flip Test)

  - Ferrofluid nanoparticle size (10nm, 20nm, 50nm)
  - Application concentration (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 mM Fe equivalent)
- **Dependent Variables**:
  - SPAD chlorophyll readings (daily for 14 days)
  - Leaf tissue iron content (ICP-MS analysis)
  - Root iron accumulation
  - Plant biomass (shoot/root dry weight)
  - Iron use efficiency (biomass per unit Fe absorbed)
- **Methodology**: 
  - Controlled hydroponic system with wheat seedlings
  - Randomized complete block design (n=6 per treatment)
  - 14-day treatment period with daily monitoring
  - Statistical analysis: ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD
- **Validity Threats & Mitigations**:
  - Confound: pH changes affecting uptake → Buffer all solutions to pH 6.5
  - Confound: Nanoparticle aggregation → DLS particle size verification
  - Bias: Observer effects → Blinded SPAD measurements
- **Success Metrics**: 
  - Primary: >20% higher iron content in ferrofluid-treated plants (p<0.05)

- **Resources**: Hydroponic setup, ICP-MS access, 4 weeks duration

### Experiment 2: Magnetic Field-Guided Precision Delivery

### Experiment 3: Cost-Effectiveness vs. Commercial Chelates
- **Objective**: Demonstrate that ferrofluids can match or exceed commercial chelate performance at lower production costs
- **Hypothesis**: Ferrofluid treatments will achieve equivalent chlorosis correction at 50% lower cost per treated hectare
- **Independent Variables**:
  - Treatment type (ferrofluid vs. Fe-EDDHA vs. Fe-DTPA vs. untreated)
  - Application rate (standard dose, half dose, double dose)
  - Soil type (alkaline field soil, sandy soil, clay soil)
  - Application frequency (single vs. split applications)
- **Dependent Variables**:
  - Treatment cost per hectare (materials + application)
  - Chlorosis recovery time (days to 90% green coverage)
  - Yield impact (grain weight per plant)

- **Methodology**:
  - Field-scale randomized trials (1m² plots, n=5 per treatment)
  - Economic analysis with material cost tracking
  - Time-series monitoring over full growing season
  - Cost-effectiveness ratio: (yield improvement)/(treatment cost)
- **Validity Threats & Mitigations**:
