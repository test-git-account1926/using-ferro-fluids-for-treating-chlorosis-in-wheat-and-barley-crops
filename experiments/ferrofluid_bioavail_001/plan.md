# Ferrofluid vs. Traditional Iron Bioavailability Core Test

## Experiment ID: exp_ferrofluid_bioavail_001

## Objective
Test the foundational hypothesis that ferrofluids provide superior iron delivery through colloidal suspension with enhanced bioavailability compared to traditional iron chelates.

## Hypothesis
Ferrofluid-delivered iron will show 20-40% higher plant uptake efficiency compared to Fe-EDDHA under controlled hydroponic conditions.

## Methodology

### Experimental Design
- **Type**: Randomized complete block design
- **Duration**: 14 days with daily monitoring
- **Subjects**: Wheat seedlings (Triticum aestivum)
- **Environment**: Controlled hydroponic chamber

### Treatment Groups (n=5 per group)
1. **Control**: Nutrient solution without additional iron
2. **Fe-EDDHA**: Standard iron chelate (50 μM Fe)
3. **Fe-DTPA**: Alternative iron chelate (50 μM Fe)
4. **Ferrofluid-10nm**: 10nm magnetite nanoparticles (50 μM Fe equivalent)
5. **Ferrofluid-20nm**: 20nm magnetite nanoparticles (50 μM Fe equivalent)
6. **Ferrofluid-50nm**: 50nm magnetite nanoparticles (50 μM Fe equivalent)

### Measurements
- **Daily**: SPAD chlorophyll readings
- **Day 7**: Leaf and root sampling for ICP-MS iron analysis
- **Day 14**: Final biomass, total iron content, iron use efficiency

### Success Criteria
- ≥20% higher iron content in ferrofluid-treated plants
- Faster chlorophyll recovery (≥2 days earlier peak)
- Statistical significance (p < 0.05) in ANOVA analysis

## Risk Mitigation
- pH buffering to 6.5 ± 0.1 to prevent uptake interference
- Dynamic light scattering verification of particle sizes
- Blinded measurements to prevent observer bias
- Technical replicates for all analytical measurements

## Expected Timeline
- **Week 1**: Setup, seedling preparation, treatment initiation
- **Week 2**: Daily monitoring, interim sampling
- **Week 3**: Final sampling and analysis
- **Week 4**: Data analysis and reporting

## Success Vectors
This experiment tests the core assumption of superior bioavailability. Failure invalidates the entire ferrofluid approach, making this the highest-risk, highest-priority experiment.
